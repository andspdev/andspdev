## About Me
I really like making websites. In making a website, I work on the front-end and back-end. I can work in a team, reliable and responsible. In making websites, I have had experience since junior high school. This made me want to know more about the world of website creation. Apart from making websites, I am also experienced in using Linux servers, networks, editing images and videos. And I also have a hobby in creating content on blogs.
